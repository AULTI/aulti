You\u2019d catch us saying, \u201cIt\u2019s where the people are,\u201d \u201cThey want to hear from you,\u201d \u201cIt gets results,\u201d and\u2014the big one\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s free!\u201d Who could say no to that? Slowly but surely, restaurants jumped on board, and they realized that for only a few bucks they could build their following, quickly accumulating a large group of \u201clikes.\u201d Things were good. It didn\u2019t cost too much money, if anything at all.<\/p>\n<p>Then this old adage reared its ugly head:\u00a0Nothing in life is free. You have to pay to play.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook recently changed the algorithm that determines how content is displayed to its one billion-plus users. Now your content won\u2019t reach most of your fans unless you pay money to \u201cboost\u201d each post. Zing! There\u2019s the newfangled catch: You have to pay to play.<\/p>\n<p>With this change to the way Facebook displays a page\u2019s posts, it has effectively demolished its usefulness to small businesses. Start-up brands and mom-and-pop restaurants run on razor-thin budgets. Requiring them to pay for building a fan base, then asking more for fan engagement on every post, is absurd.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it like this: with the average suggested boost budget being around $10, a restaurant could easily drop $3000 each month in reaching the fans who want to hear from the restaurant. For that kind of money, I think a restaurant could be doing a lot of other things that get more attention and put \u201cbutts in seats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Without Facebook, what can we do?!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to \u201cTumble, Tweet, and \u2018Gram.\u201d Tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram have amassed a following, but have been underused because of Facebook\u2019s powerful reach. With that reach now being eliminated, these newer social media platforms will take you out of the din of the Facebook desert and give your marketing a little bit more boost. They&#8217;ve proven effective, although at a smaller scale than Facebook so far, and they continue to grow. That means they\u2019re getting more and more attention from the market, which will help your messages be heard. They&#8217;ve sat in Facebook\u2019s shadow for too long. Now is the time to jump on board.<\/p>\n<p>Tumblr. 13 percent of Internet users between the ages of 18-29 use Tumblr1. With Yahoo\u2019s purchase of Tumblr, this platform has exploded. Tumblr has reformatted its original direction. It\u2019s now basically a website creation tool with a built-in way for fans to receive updates. Think of it like this: it\u2019s a completely customizable Facebook page, with a network of easily accessible fans. When you post new content to your Tumblr \u201cwebsite,\u201d people can repost it, comment on it, or \u201cheart\u201d it\u2014akin to \u201cliking\u201d a status on Facebook. They can also follow your brand so they\u2019re always in the know about new posts, for free. It\u2019s full social engagement in an space that\u2019s connected to a network, but branded for your restaurant experience.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter.\u00a018 percent of all Internet users are using Twitter2. With the addition of pictures, videos, and a new profile layout that is unmistakably Facebook-inspired, Twitter is upping the ante. It keeps things simple with the status updates (no more than 144 characters), but it\u2019s effective. Your followers will see everything you post, and you can even advertise to build fan engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram. 17 percent of Internet users are on Instagram2. Instagram boils down one powerful feature that Facebook has: Pictures. Posting images of your food, your employees having fun, your customers, and other brand-charged images that make your restaurant real and human can help build fan engagement and buzz. You can tag other Instagram users to help create community, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, each of these social media platforms pale in comparison to Facebook\u2019s usage (two-thirds of Internet users.) Consider these two points, however: 1) What good is your marketing if it falls on deaf ears? And 2) if they\u2019re really fans of yours, they\u2019ll find you in other places. In Facebook\u2019s case, your marketing isn\u2019t even reaching those \u201cdeaf ears.\u201d You\u2019re better off starting to use new platforms with an engaged audience who will actually receive your brilliant transmissions. Also, don&#8217;t you think it\u2019s better to have a handful of actively interested audience than a mass of uninterested followers who are one post away from being annoyed by your brand?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s good to remember that beyond social media is a world of online opportunities for those who can think outside the proverbial box. Successful marketing should be thought of as a campaign that spans across many media outlets, not just one &#8220;silver bullet&#8221; expected to work wonders. Restaurant brands that put some creative thought and a reasonable marketing budget behind good ideas will be the ones that get the attention and the inevitable traffic that comes along with good marketing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you using Tumblr, Twitter, or Instagram?
