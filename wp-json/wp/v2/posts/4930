As we look back at 2018, we took notice to some of our clients who were absolutely exceptional at leveraging Instagram. Instagram offers so much value as a long-form ongoing storytelling platform that increases your brand&#8217;s reach and ability to optimize frequency. It&#8217;s THE best way to tell your story day-in and day-out. While organic reach becomes more and more difficult due to the need to monetize the platform, striving to build your audience becomes even more critical. Additionally, larger audiences open up bigger opportunities for visibility and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Audiences are built through creative content that&#8217;s worth viewing, engaging with, and talking about with others. In our opinion, the following client accounts did a stellar job of checking that box and more. They deserve a high five and acknowledgment (and a follow!) Congratulations, friends, you&#8217;re killing it!<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/johnnysph\/\">1. Johnny&#8217;s Pizza House<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Johnny&#8217;s is a fast-casual pizza powerhouse out of Louisiana and one of our longest clients. During our collaboration, <a href=\"https:\/\/vigorbranding.com\/portfolio\/johnnys-pizza-house-rebranding\/\">we&#8217;ve designed and launched a successful rebrand<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/vigorbranding.com\/portfolio\/johnnys-pizza-house-kajun-krewe-advertising-campaign\/\">crafted engaging and unforgettable LTO marketing campaigns<\/a>, and served as a strategic partner to move them ahead. In 2018, we made the decision to build a small in-house team to fully service the brand&#8217;s needs. That decision has proved highly valuable and there is no other place where that success if more visible than their\u00a0Instagram.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4932\" src=\"https:\/\/vigorbranding.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/johnnys-pizza-house-instagram-600x393.png\" alt=\"Johnny's Pizza House instagram story\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/slapfish\">2.
