However, viewing social media as strictly a sales and traffic driving media is detrimentally myopic.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are other, important benefits to social media marketing that go beyond the sales and traffic focus. These benefits shouldn\u2019t be discounted, because they are the beginning points of driving those core metrics. People don\u2019t jump from awareness to purchase. The Patron\u2019s journey is much longer than that.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It\u2019s important to buy-in to the other benefits and the role they play in that Patron\u2019s journey. Here are three of the top benefits to strong social media strategies and content for restaurant brands:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">1. Builds reasons to believe brand\u00a0claims<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Brands make a lot of claims to the world. Restaurant brands are no different. \u201cWe have the best _______\u201d, \u201cOur quality is unrivaled\u201d, and many other hollow proclamations are spouted into the world. People\u2019s gut reaction to these claims is either skepticism, disbelieve, or somewhere in between.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Social media is the only type of platform that empowers brands to prove those claims in an ongoing, ever-building story. The many tools and opportunities found on Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms give brands the ability to show the quality of the ingredients, cooking\/preparation, and outputs in real-time. With video, slideshows, imagery, and multiple types of delivery, social media is the place to give Patrons reasons to believe your claims.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">2. Attracts higher quality\u00a0talent<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This has been a hot button issue for the restaurant industry in the past, and it\u2019s exacerbated due to the Pandemic\u2019s effects. People on the team need to feel like the restaurant\u200a\u2014\u200abe it one unit or many, independently owned or franchised\u200a\u2014\u200aand management has their health, safety, and career as their top priority. And, unfortunately, for many restaurant brands, their teams aren\u2019t feeling that at all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Social media can change those perceptions in conjunction with operational shifts that genuinely put the team\u2019s safety first. Through effective messaging and visual storytelling, restaurants can show safety procedures in place and represent their dedication to the team.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In addition to the safety cues, people want to work for the places they love. There is no stronger platform for building that love than social media. A strong, creative approach to social media can guide the Patron\u2019s perceptions of the brand from dull, boring, and \u201cfast food\u201d to upbeat, modern, and fun. In doing so that brand has a better opportunity to be considered by talent now and in the future.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">3. Fosters brand adoration and\u00a0advocacy<\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just as create social media can attract talent, it also builds adoration for the restaurant brand which translates into loyalty and advocacy. In short, a strong social story can get them to fall in love with you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">But it takes more than snapping pictures of the food. Even when that food looks so dang delicious, people are looking for much more than that. Gone are the days where food porn gets all the views. Now, people want to see a human element. They want to be taken behind the curtain into deeper content than they could find otherwise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Develop ways to connect your followers with the purest heart of your brand using more than still images. Dive into video, motion, and slideshows. Show your people and personality in action. Watch as engagement and followship rises.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Social media for restaurants is meant for so much more than driving sales and traffic. The more immediate benefits are in building the brand\u2019s perceptions, awareness, and advocacy from Patrons and potential talent. Longer down the line, sales and traffic do happen.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just as with any marketing endeavor, that direct line from tactic to result is a dangerous metric to evaluate. Looking for linear paths in marketing is myopic and ignores the cumulative power and momentum that an omnichannel approach inevitably creates.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More often than not, when I get into a conversation about social media marketing for restaurants, there are numerous pushbacks. \u201cSocial doesn\u2019t drive sales and traffic\u201d and \u201cwhat good is engagement if sales don\u2019t increase\u201d are usually top responses in a mix of many other perceptions that devalue social media\u2019s role in the restaurant marketing [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":61996,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"googlesitekitpersistent_idea_text":""},"categories":[412],"tags":[207,41],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v18.4 (Yoast SEO v19.6.1) -
