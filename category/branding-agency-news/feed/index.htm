										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Principal, Joseph Szala, lends his expertise to two articles about restaurant branding and naming. The first article discusses the nuances of restaurant naming and how it pertains to a new fast casual restaurant in Washington, DC. The second, published on Vox, speculates the real reasons for Hooters&#8217; decline. Is it the uniform? The format? Millennials&#8217; disinterest in female anatomy?</p>
<h2>[Washingtonian] Is “I’m Eddie Cano” a Good Name For a Restaurant? We Asked an Expert</h2>
<p>New fast casual Italian joint opened in DC with a name that caused quite a stir. The good people at the Washingtonian discussed the restaurant&#8217;s name, pros, cons, and general naming advice with Joseph. <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/10/11/is-im-eddie-cano-a-good-name-for-a-restaurant-we-asked-an-expert/">Read the full article »</a></p>
<h2>Hooters is closing restaurants. Is its offensive uniform to blame?</h2>
<p>As Hooters&#8217; future waivers, speculation surrounding the uniforms and concept&#8217;s primary offering come into question. Joseph discusses the implications of this dated restaurant concept and brand with the people at Vox.com. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/4/17911936/hooters-uniform-breastaurant-decline">Read the full article »</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Branding is one of the most misconceived labels in business today. There are thousands of books on the topic, and ten times as many ideas of what it is and isn&#8217;t. Rather than get mired in the details and minutiae of the definition, I lay out five lessons derived from famous bull parables from around the world. These lessons, when applied, help build any brand despite having a clear, accurate definition of &#8220;branding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lara Hodgson and I discuss business today, how to build brands, and answer some key questions from the listeners/watchers. If you don&#8217;t know Lara and her company, NOWAccount, you best give them a look. Their ideal and service is perfect for the business to business community who constantly struggle with accounts receivable. She and her term have changed the game in that arena, and will continue to innovate because it&#8217;s in their DNA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Want to know more about the newest member to the Vigor team? Well, here&#8217;s a step inside the mind of our Natalie Suarez, designer and copywriter extraordinaire:</div>
<h2><span class="im"><b>What would you eat for your last dinner? Why?</b></span></h2>
<div>So, my family celebrates Noche Buena on Christmas Eve, which is essentially a big buffet with lots of booze and dancing and every member of my extended family shows up. My dad will roast a whole pig for 12 hours, my aunt makes her signature flan, people just bring whatever they make best and its just a great meal. So, if I had to choose it would be that, but the stipulation is that I have my family there sharing it with me. Some of my fondest memories growing up happen around that dinner, preparing the food and sharing it with my family, and as I&#8217;ve moved away from South Florida I&#8217;ve realized how representative it is of my Cuban roots, so I try to do a mini-version of it with my inlaws and friends every year.</div>
<h2><span class="im"><b>What&#8217;s your go to beverage/cocktail? Why?</b></span></h2>
<div>Bourbon is always a good idea, and my go-to these days is an Old Fashioned. There&#8217;s no real reason behind it other than I don&#8217;t like super sweet or fruity drinks, so bourbon cocktails tend to walk that line. If not that, I&#8217;ve been into making El Presidente&#8217;s lately, which is a Cuban cocktail that was popular during Cuba&#8217;s heyday in the 50s. It&#8217;s typically made with white rum, a white vermouth, triple sec, and real grenadine (not that bottled sugar water), but the version I like to make uses aged rum and Lillet instead of vermouth.</div>
<h2><b>What do you love to do in your freetime?</b></h2>
<div>Hiking, knitting, cooking/baking are the top three right now, although it varies. I&#8217;m knitting socks for Christmas for some of my family members and that&#8217;s been taking up most of my time a) because socks are complicated and b) I have to fight my cat every time I break out the yarn. I also just really enjoy trying new things, seeing new places, etc. I try to not eat at the same restaurant twice or go on the same hike twice, just to see what else is out there.</div>
<h2><span class="im"><b>If you had to open your own restaurant, what would it serve? What would you call it?</b></span></h2>
<div>Ok so legitimately my back up plan in highschool if the graphic design thing didn&#8217;t work out was to open a bakery. One dumb idea I had was to make a pie and muffin hybrid and call them puffins, yes like the bird. I never got to making a name for it but my thought was just to make outrageous flavor combinations for things like cupcakes, bagels, and cakes.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago we sought to find a rockstar designer who could challenge conventions and bring a fresh eye to our clients and their work. Ms. Leah Ayer walked through our door with a portfolio that demonstrated that, and so much more. Her work demonstrated great thinking and execution in design and creative. From her innovative packaging for <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/29119239/Converse-Shoe-Packaging">Converse</a> to her brilliant rethinking of <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/29120531/Great-Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>, Leah&#8217;s work pushes the boundaries on the expected.</p>
<p>Leah spent some time at a few agencies with great reputations after graduating from The Portfolio Center. Crispin, Porter, and Bogusky, and Imbibe, were just two of her stops before landing here at Vigor. In between agency life, she found a love and passion for flowers and floral design, something that often comes through in her work.</p>
<p>As a way to introduce Leah to our audience, we had a short one-on-one chat about food, drink, and design. Get to know our newest design maven in her profound answers below, and check out some of her work below that!</p>
<hr />
<h2>What would you eat for your last dinner? Why?</h2>
<p>Pizza! More specifically Antico’s San Gennaro Pizza, because if you have to ask then you need to try it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What&#8217;s your go to beverage/cocktail? Why?</h2>
<p>I’ve been into trying new beers lately and I have a lot of fun checking out breweries but I can&#8217;t turn down a margarita thats been made with fresh limes. Because tequila.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What do you love to do in your freetime?</h2>
<p>I love being outside whether it&#8217;s hiking, camping, swimming at the lake, or wading in a creek. I also spend a lot of time watching movies, Tony and I have been working on watching all the movies on the top 100 list since we met 9 years ago. I was raised on TV and VHS tapes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>If you had to open your own restaurant, what would it serve? What would you call it?</h2>
<p>Tough question. It would probably be a dessert restaurant, and we’d serve only the best cookies, brownies, cake, pie, and ice cream including adult/alcoholic versions of all these things. I could call it ‘Zerts, the name is a WIP.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next time you&#8217;re in the office, please give Ms. Leah a big high-five and hello!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like the feeling of winning. Especially when the competition is fierce. We are honored to announce that Graphis, a renowned design publication, has saw fit to award Vigor silver in their 2016 Design Annual. The design and branding work for the Burger Radio food truck has officially been recognized as best in class.</p>
<p>We knew from the first call with David Levine, owner and visionary behind Burger Radio, that this project would be something special. There was immediate chemistry and alignment on the vision and idea from the beginning which led to an amazing working relationship. The results are a thriving burger business that&#8217;s looking to move to a brick and mortar location while receiving many accolades over the past couple of years. For us, we get recognized for a job well done.</p>
<p>Special thanks to David for letting us be just as crazy and he, and to giving us the opportunity to do excellent, now &#8220;award-winning,&#8221; work.</p>
