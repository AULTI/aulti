Read part one <a href=\"https:\/\/vigorbranding.com\/2017\/10\/31\/know-thy-position-strategy-series-15\/\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Imagine you&#8217;ve been dating someone special for a few months. Things are going <em>great<\/em>. The two of you are on an idyllic date at the county fair when your significant other drops a bomb: their parents have invited you to dinner. You&#8217;ve never met before.<\/p>\n<p>No problem, you think. You&#8217;ll just bring a thoughtful gift to make a great first impression. Hoping to get some intel, you casually ask your date other to tell you a bit about their parents. Then this happens:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My mom is female, caucasian, between the ages of 45 and 65. Some college education. My dad is male, latino, between the ages of 45 and 65. Bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher. Together, they have three kids and a household income between $75,000 and $150,000.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Am I dating a robot?&#8221; You ask yourself.\u00a0Intent on not spoiling your date, you play it cool and pretend that wasn&#8217;t weird.<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, you make famously good chocolate peanut-butter cookies, and basically everybody loves cookies. No problem.<\/p>\n<p>Except there&#8217;s a problem. You don&#8217;t discover the problem until later, when your date&#8217;s mom, after her first bite of your famous cookies, asks, &#8220;do these have peanuts in them?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Jif extra creamy!&#8221; You grin. But she isn&#8217;t grinning. She&#8217;s making oddest expression you&#8217;ve ever seen. Sort of pouty. No, puffy. Swollen!<\/p>\n<h2>Rather than impressing your date&#8217;s mom, you get to watch your date stab her with an epipen. Everything blows over, including your relationship.<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The problem wasn&#8217;t with the cookies. They really were delicious. It was that you didn&#8217;t know anything <em>useful<\/em> about who you were making them for.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly the predicament of brand owners who know some things\u00a0<em>about<\/em> their patron, but don&#8217;t actually\u00a0<em>know their patron<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s rewind the tape. This time, when you ask your date to tell you about their parents, they reply:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My mom&#8217;s name is Barbara. She&#8217;s a little shy but the quintessential adventurer\u2014that&#8217;s how she met my dad, backpacking in Costa Rica. He was her guide. They travelled a lot before having me and my sisters. My dad, Martin, is really creative. He&#8217;s a studio photographer. Oh yeah, and my mom is super allergic to peanuts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Now you know something useful. You show up with tamales and flan. It reminds your date&#8217;s parents of their travels together. Nobody gets stabbed. Your love flourishes.<\/p>\n<p>Whether your own a restaurant, franchise brand, beverage brand, or hotel, knowing your patron means knowing a real human being, not just some stats. Having this knowledge can mean the difference between major brand blunders and winning undying loyalty. That&#8217;s why, once we&#8217;ve established a brand&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/vigorbranding.com\/2017\/10\/31\/know-thy-position-strategy-series-15\/\">position<\/a>, we create a named, living, breathing Patron with goals, challenges, and interests.
