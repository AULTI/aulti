Operating in your core competencies\u2014serving food to restaurant patrons\u2014is severely hampered.\u00a0Even if you\u2019re fortunate enough to have a drive-thru or a strong delivery business, you, like all of us, are left asking some extremely important questions. The most important of which is, \u201chow do we get through this and weather the storm?<\/p>\n<p>While there are no simple answers to surviving the economic halt this pandemic has caused, there does exist an even greater question in the nuance of the word, \u201chow.\u201d How you get through this will determine how your brand recovers post-pandemic. I\u2019m not talking about marketing tactics and deals\/promotions. I\u2019m talking about the actions your brand will take and the manner in which you take them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is the time to transcend the surface answer of \u201cwe feed people\u201d and discover a deeper sense of brand purpose and how it manifests in real life.<\/strong>\u00a0It\u2019s time to leverage your values to fuel customer engagement, innovation, and opportunity not only to survive COVID-19, but to come out of it with more momentum behind your brand than it\u2019s ever had before.<\/p>\n<p>How is that possible? The simple, yet difficult answer is this: dig into your values and turn them into action. Live your \u201cwhy,\u201d your brand\u2019s purpose, in your circle of influence and the world around you.<\/p>\n<p>If that sounds a little woo, or even detached from the harsh realities of slumping sales and the need to conserve as much cash as possible, let me propose that living your brand values is the\u00a0<i>most<\/i>\u00a0practical thing to do not only in a crisis but at any time. After all, what you do during a crisis very much dictates the believability of your claims during good times. As Dr. Martin Luther King said, \u201cThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\u201d And nothing could be truer at this moment.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. \u2013 Dr. Martin Luther King<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, how does this come to life for you and your brand? Rather than wax on philosophically, here are some examples of core values (you shouldn\u2019t have too many, or they\u2019re not core), and some ways to act on them:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Value: Convenience<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Action: create an LTO family meal engage your owned audience around third party delivery so they don\u2019t even have to pick up.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Value: a moment of fun<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Action: re-think your social engagement from a standpoint of empathy for restless families stuck at home and provide novel, brand-connected ways to play games, engage each other, and learn<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Value: wellness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Action: promote a free small item for healthcare workers, or better yet, cater a meal to their break room and share the experience via social<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Value: friendship<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Action: encourage your community manager to engage 1:1 with patrons on social and share something positive about those patrons to your larger audience<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Value: taking care of the team<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Action: educate your team on how to take advantage of the coronavirus stimulus check, or set up a GoFundMe campaign for an employee in a time of particular crisis<\/em><\/p>\n<p>These are just a few ways that your brand values can lead to meaningful action, which in turn drives engagement from loyal patrons and the larger community alike. The re-tooling needed to achieve these efforts becomes a natural source of innovation that can serve long after Coronavirus has bit the dust. Your brand\u2019s values should directly dictate the actions taken to prove to the world around you that you genuinely mean them.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of which, we\u2019re reminding our clients every chance we get that this crisis will not last forever, but what people remember about their response very well could. How will people remember your brand when all of this is over? Hopefully, as a company that feeds people in more ways than one, and a brand that has doubled up on its promises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let\u2019s state the obvious: During this COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants are being left without dining rooms, and sometimes without essential staff.
