										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The restaurant industry is finally in the thick of it when it comes to the technology revolution. Realizing the role tech plays in helping agile pivots and adjustments (thanks pandemic!) brands are embracing, integrating, and innovating left and right. Helping that charge is a suite of new technology platforms that seek to solve stubborn challenges the has faced and continues to face. In this series, we unpack restaurant technologies that we have found to be notable, invaluable, and remarkable. In this installment, we dive into the restaurant gratuity platform, <a href="https://kickfin.com/">Kickfin</a>.</p>
<p>Tipping out has many challenges no matter what your restaurant&#8217;s service model may be. Cash on hand at this scale can create issues with safety and fraud. Gratuity, in general, is problematic as well in that it can directly affect the morale of the team. Who gets what percentage? Did they really earn it? This kind of gray area creates unnecessary tension. On the back end of things, there is the reporting and accounting that go into tracking gratuity. It&#8217;s a pain, to say the least. Enter Kickfin, a new fintech company that&#8217;s tackling those challenges with fervor.</p>
<p>Kickfin has created &#8220;the perfect tip-out solution&#8221; where restaurant operators can send tips directly to their employees’ bank accounts, any time, any day. In fact, Kickfin claims you can tip out your entire staff in 30 seconds. Whoa!</p>
<p>The benefits for integrating Kickfin are multi-faceted. In my opinion, the most important benefit is the uplift in employee morale which leads directly to retention. In an era where finding and retaining talent is harder than ever, this may be the only reason a brand needs to implement the Kickfin system. Diving deeper the benefits are pretty obvious. There are savings of time by those charged with calculating and paying out tips. A reduction in physical cash on hand means employees are safer and less prone to threats of robbery or worse. They get paid immediately, so no more waiting for the credit card transactions to post before seeing it on the paystub.  Finally, the system reduces the need to hit the bank multiple times a week creating a notable reduction in wasted time and money.</p>
<p>As we look to the future of operations and restaurant service models, QSR is becoming more and more a tipping scenario. For better or worse, the tablet POS systems have made gratuity more frequent. This helps woo talent to the concepts that can help them realize more financial benefits like those found with gratuity.</p>
<p>Overall, Kickfin has marked the issue of tipping out as more than solved. It&#8217;s a fantastic product that every restaurant leader should consider.</p>

				<p>Ah yes, it&#8217;s that time of the year, literally the last day, where we throw down some bold predictions for the restaurant industry. Not necessarily in what foods will be trending, but more focused on larger shifts and notable changes to be expected in 2022.</p><p>This future-casting is fueled by our discussions with leaders on the <a href="https://www.forktales.co">Forktales podcast</a>, thought leadership that we&#8217;ve provided in the trades, and keeping a keen eye on the news and journalism from day-to-day. There are a few major realities unfolding that I think will fuel these trends. Namely, the skyrocketing inflation, stagnant employment, and the lengthened pandemic will all affect how people behave and what they want from restaurants moving forward.</p><p>For starters, it&#8217;s safe to say that health and safety aren&#8217;t temporary focal points for operations and messaging. They&#8217;re must-haves just as caring about the carbon footprint and impact on the environment are expectations at this point. Additionally, quality of product and sourcing is important to patrons and will remain so. That&#8217;s not to say that buzzwords like &#8220;local&#8221; and &#8220;organic&#8221; are the only way to do business, but knowing where the product is sourced helps fuel the patron&#8217;s reasons to believe in the brand and value of what they&#8217;re buying.</p><p>So, without future adieu, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in store for 2022:</p><h3>1. Tech Titans Get Connected</h3><p>It&#8217;s time that technology goes from the ad-hoc systems-integration-after-the-fact approach to actual, realized convergence. 2022 will see big moves towards that goal. Whether it&#8217;s via cooperation between players large and small, or acquisition-fueled, technology pillars must start to work together in unison. We&#8217;ve already seen some shifts ahead like Zenreach&#8217;s name change and flag-in-the-ground moment. Now called Adentro, the company focuses less on basic wifi gating, and more on an entire in-store ecosystem. Convergence will help restaurants further their push to more optimized operations which cannot happen soon enough.</p><h3>2. Crypto Kicks Off</h3><p>There is a massive amount of movement in the crypto-world and for most, it&#8217;s over the head and confusing. As crypto shifts to more mainstream, and it already is, restaurants have a way to capitalize, and they should. Inflation leads to furthering the instability of the dollar and other traditional currencies. The big wall keeping crypto from going mainstream is how it&#8217;s accepted at scale. We need to see a world where crypto is used for purchases at the counter, at the back door, and everywhere else. Additionally, Crypto needs to solve the carbon-footprint issue that&#8217;s caused major influencers to take a step back from it. This could be that year. Crypto, although still volatile, offers a bright future for restaurants.</p><h3>3. Virtual Kitchens Find Real Traction</h3><p>To date, Virtual and Ghost Kitchens have been in an early adoption phase. Yes, there are kinks to iron out and some struggles to overcome, but it&#8217;s safe to say the industry is invested in the potential of these concepts. Quite simply, they offer ways for restaurants to fill in gaps in revenue and maximize the revenue potential of their brick and mortar. Because of this energy and focus, virtual kitchens will continue to grow in popularity, the bumps will be worked out, and strong concepts will get traction and thrive.</p><h3>4. Budget is King</h3><p>Inflation is real and it&#8217;s affecting those who comprise a very large portion of restaurant patrons. That means budgets are cinching up and people are keeping their eyes on their budget. This will have very negative consequences for struggling brands. On the flip side, there is an opportunity to reclaim value-minded approaches to the P-mix and offering. Deals, value meals, and other value-focused offerings will thrive this year and year to come as a result.</p><h3>5. High Value for High Touch</h3><p>As large brands surge towards streamlining operations with technology that eliminates/reduces workforce and increases focus on delivery, pickup, and drive-thru, the people will be left with a hole. The fact is, despite our collective move towards more delivery and pickup, human connection is a very real human need. That will leave an opportunity open for high-touch experiences that are safe but more experiential-driven.</p><h3>6. Push Back to Suburbia</h3><p>Major American cities are seeing violent increases in crime and cost of living. This has happened before and what we saw was a push to suburban living. In a lot of ways, this is cyclical so it&#8217;s easy to see it happening again. Suburban areas will see a big rise in population in 2022 whether it&#8217;s from the bordering city dwellers or transplants from other US cities looking for a lower cost of living. It&#8217;s already happening in the South in cities like Nashville, Atlanta, and Florida in general. The surge will continue making real estate and opportunities in the suburbs absolutely prime.</p><h3>7. Here Come the Robots</h3><p>Yes, robots are here and more are coming and that spans not only literal machines in the kitchen, but also Artificial Intelligence. Automation, in general, will be one of the keys to realizing success and profitability in 2022. Whether it&#8217;s replacing the front line with kiosks, or having a system that builds, bakes and boxes pizza, robotics and automation are going to revolutionize the quick-serve space.</p><p>By no means are these the only trends, but I do believe they&#8217;ll be the biggest, notable shifts. Suffice to say things are always in tumult due to outside factors like the Pandemic. Despite those types of influences, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that 2022 will be wild in what we see come out of the industry and how we adapt and continue to evolve as consumers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The rise of “spooky” kitchens</h2>
<p>If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve heard the term “ghost kitchen” a lot in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>You’ve probably also heard terms like dark kitchen, cloud kitchen, and shadow kitchen. For better or worse, these spooky kitchen terms reflect the way the restaurant industry is grappling with the rapid emergence of new market-driven and tech-enabled restaurant models.</p>
<p>As a restaurant branding specialist, I will readily admit that even after lots of research—and working with clients in this space—I was still confused about what exactly these terms mean, how they’re the same, and how they’re different. And as a word nerd with a love for naming things, I can’t sleep soundly knowing that this confusion could go on for years to come.</p>
<p>This problem requires urgent attention. As new restaurant models gain momentum, they’re not only top-of-mind for industry folks—they will become top-of-mind for consumers too. Insiders may tolerate the muddle for a while, but confusing consumers hurts the restaurant space as a whole. In an industry where consumers demand transparency and trustworthiness, spooky kitchen terms invite suspicion.</p>
<p>The problem extends beyond the spooky terms listed above. Below is a selection of terms I’ve come across so far:</p>
<p>Virtual Restaurant, Ghost Restaurant, Commissary Kitchen, Ghost Kitchen, Blackbox Kitchen, Virtual Kitchen, Dark Kitchen, Shadow Kitchen, Cloud Kitchen, Central Kitchen, Rent-a-Kitchen, Off-premise Kitchen, Shared Kitchen, Incubator Kitchen, Cloud Commissary, Delivery-only Brand, Virtual Brand, Digital Restaurant Brand.</p>
<p>In an effort to clear things up (or at least provoke some conversation), I’ve sorted through these terms and evaluated them on popularity, clarity, and perception to produce a new glossary of terminology and definitions that can help us move into the future with confidence.</p>
<p>Note: when we’re talking about where food is made, we’re talking about kitchens. When we’re talking about how the food is and experience is delivered, we’re talking about restaurants.</p>
<p>Here it is for consideration and feedback.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Model Glossary</h2>
<p><strong>Traditional Restaurant</strong><br />
<em>A restaurant with an attached kitchen that offers dine-in and may offer takeout, drive-through, delivery, curbside delivery, or any combination of these.</em></p>
<p>With so many new models at play, we can’t just assume that “restaurant” means a traditional restaurant anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Flextaurant</strong><br />
<em>A non-traditional restaurant and/or food production facility with food produced in a central kitchen, a kitchen space belonging to another brand, or a mobile kitchen, e.g. a food truck.</em></p>
<p>In contrast with Traditional Restaurants, Flextaurants are an umbrella term that includes everything that follows:</p>
<p><strong>Central Kitchen</strong><br />
<em>A food production and storage facility with no attached dine-in restaurant.</em></p>
<p><strong>     Shared Central Kitchen</strong><br />
<em>     A Central Kitchen that leases some or all of its capacity to other brands.</em></p>
<p><strong>     Private Central Kitchen</strong><br />
<em>     A Central Kitchen that is wholly owned by a single entity and used exclusively for the production of one or more brands of food for that entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Restaurant</strong><br />
<em>A restaurant brand with food produced in a central kitchen or traditional restaurant under a different brand than that restaurant, available for delivery and sometimes for pickup.</em></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Food Hall</strong><br />
<em>A collection of Virtual Restaurants presented to consumers via a shared ordering platform.</em></p>
<p><strong>     Owned Virtual Food Hall</strong><br />
<em>     A virtual food hall in which the brands and products being offered are owned by the entity that is retailing them.</em></p>
<p><strong>     Curated Virtual Food Hall</strong><br />
<em>     A virtual food hall in which the brands and products being offered are owned by entities other than the retailer.</em></p>
<p>The flexibility of Virtual Restaurants offers exciting opportunities for the virtual-equivalents of traditional food halls. One such example (and a Vigor client) is <a href="https://www.scratchkitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scratch Kitchen</a> in Boulder, Colorado. They’re a Virtual Food Hall currently offering 7 brands all operating out of one location.</p>
<h2>Runner-up Terminology</h2>
<p>As you read through the glossary, I’m sure you wondered why some more popular terms weren’t included. Here are some runner-up terms and why I think they fall short on either popularity, clarity, or perception.</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Kitchen</strong><br />
Wins the popularity contest, but loses on clarity (is the food made for or by ghosts? Spooky!) and perception (what are they hiding?)</p>
<p><strong>Commissary Kitchen</strong><br />
Helpful when referring to a central kitchen, but strongly associated with institutional food, which can create issues of clarity and perception. Best to let this one refer to what it’s always referred to, rather than loop it into the Flextaurant space.</p>
<p><strong>Blackbox Kitchen</strong><br />
Not very popular, and explicitly states that what’s happening behind closed doors is some kind of hidden secret—the opposite of what we want for positive perceptions.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Kitchen</strong><br />
Seems promising at first blush, except that in a Virtual Kitchen model, the only thing that isn’t virtual is the kitchen. A contradiction in terms.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Kitchen</strong><br />
Unless someone didn’t pay the power bill, this isn’t a term that should be used. Too foreboding.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow Kitchen</strong><br />
We’re making food, not casting spells.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Kitchen</strong><br />
Actually a very promising term—it’s popular, it feels tech-forward, descriptive, and positive. But, easily confused with the CloudKitchens ® brand name.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>As part of my research for this article, I consulted with Jake Malanoski of Scratch Kitchen to get an insider perspective on the Flextaurant space. He pointed to several emerging models that aren’t even addressed here. The most interesting are what we might call development kitchens, which are solely focused on creating new menus and brands to license to others for production and delivery. In a way, this is the natural next step in the evolution from traditional restaurants, to flextaurants, to pure intellectual property development. Oh, and those enigmatic NFTs we’ve all been hearing about? I’m sure they’ll be intersecting with the restaurant space as well.</p>
<p>To me, the most exciting takeaway from all of this change and complexity is something pretty simple: for restaurants, technology is enabling more creativity. This creativity is on the entrepreneurial side, the branding side, and the culinary side. Flextaurants offer a brave new world of innovation, as well as new challenges in how best to create connected, meaningful brand experiences for consumers. And that’s something worth talking about.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the times you have picked up on a scent and it reminded you of someone or something in your past. Or those late nights you stay on instagram for an absurd amount of time scrolling through Mukbang videos even if you absolutely hate the sound of people slurping noodles and crunching various fried foods&#8230; No? Just me? Anyway, sense stimuli is very powerful and it influences what decisions we make, whether we realize it or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is our senses are classified by everything we can touch, smell, see, and hear. It has been proven time after time that brands are more memorable when the experience stimulates most, if not all, of the senses. Every industry from automotive, cosmetics, to hospitality has used sensory tactics to enhance the consumer’s cognitive experience and intensify the brand perception.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you use these universal strategies and apply them to restaurant industry marketing?</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulating through interior design</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-premise sight and feel experience is shaped largely by the interior design of the space, as a restaurant should be satisfying the smell and taste aspect of the senses. Consider everything the guest will see, touch, and hear, and you realize how critical it is to make sure every aspect supports a memorable moment. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interior design is responsible for the look and feel of the on-premise experience. A restaurant is already satisfying the smell and taste aspect of the senses (or it should be). It’s critical to examine how we can engage in other ways to make memorable moments. Consider everything the guest will see, touch, and hear. For example, if a surface is too cold or rough, it could negatively impact their experience. On the other spectrum, the hand of the upholstery, the menu coverings, paper finish or texture can have a lasting effect on a guest’s experience. The overall aesthetics will visually stimulate by using attractive colors and lighting that will add to the </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/how-to-create-an-on-brand-restaurant-interior-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cohesiveness of the interior design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and branding. </span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiential stimulus marketing</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, marketing isn’t limited to digital avenues or OOH—innovation and creativity is key. A great example of successful sensory marketing  is Dunkin’ Donuts in South Korea. When the DD jingle played on municipal buses, an atomizer released a coffee aroma. This campaign </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/the-science-of-sensory-marketing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased visits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Dunkin’ Donuts outlets near bus stops by 16% and sales at those outlets by 29%. By stimulating two senses that are associated with a brand, the strategy encourages consumers to think of the brand subconsciously. And they aren’t the first brand to reap rewards from this sort of innovative thinking: </span><a href="https://phdprincess.com/blog/disney-smells"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been using “Smellitzers” (vents that pump out various scents throughout the park) to immersify the rides but to also trigger hunger and cravings. The smell of popcorn in some parts of the park are intentional—it’s time for a snack break! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of ways you can combine these elements to create immersive experiences. These innovative combinations will engage the guest and keep your brand memorable.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulation on social media </span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is the insatiable monster of the marketing industry, and we don’t see it going anywhere anytime soon. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest are the top platforms for restaurants and it’s become increasingly challenging to stand out with users and consumers being bombarded with unique images and content daily. It’s become a must to follow what is trending, but at the same time, remain different.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test unique strategies on different platforms. Explore producing videos with an ASMR microphone for TikTok and YouTube. Share them on other platforms to gather view and engagement data. Create captivating videos with slow motion ingredient pours, or try micro lens imagery to show hi-definition textures that your followers feel like they can taste and touch. Because it’s impossible to smell through your phone or laptop, be descriptive in the captions or video. Remain visually enticing by capturing the steam of aroma rising from the food. These explorations will make your brand stand out and keep it top of mind when a consumer considers where to dine next. You can find other Instagram tips for restaurant marketing </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/7-restaurant-instagram-marketing-tips-for-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operational opportunities</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrons are made aware of a brand and are initially enticed through the door through effective marketing strategies. Once they’re in, thoughtful and considerate interior design is what builds on the brand and associated experience. But then what? Now it’s time for the operational team to make that experience one for the guest to remember and want to come back to. There are many sensory marketing opportunities that have the potential to make a great impact on guest behavior. Something as small as offering a warm towel instead of a moist (yuck!) towelette, makes a difference when it comes down to the wire! A drive-thru experience could include music and wafts of product aroma as they are ordering—look me in the eye and tell me you haven’t ordered an extra order of fries just because they smelled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tying in the visuals of a perfectly plated meal with the right music and/or atmospheric sounds will create an all around on-brand sensory experience. It’s also important to consider consumer behavioral shifts that may impact trends in a </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/seven-pivotal-trends-for-restaurants-in-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-pandemic world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senses affect the deepest part of our brains and subconsciously influence what decisions we make. Expanding marketing thinking past headlines and promotions will keep things fresh and Patrons engaged. Sensory marketing is understanding what other tactics can be used to keep brands memorable.</span></p>					</div>

				<p class="p1">Studies have shown that it takes about 2 months to form new habits<span class="s1"><sup>1</sup></span>. Considering the world has been, and in some cases continues to be, locked down for over a year, it’s safe to say some new behaviors have taken hold and show no signs of shifting back. While many people thirst for travel and dining experiences, others are apprehensive and hesitant to jump back into the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">This reality has shifted the food and beverage game as it pertains to hotels and hospitality. Prior to the pandemic, food and beverage innovation had been a hot topic in the hotel industry. It was one of the last ways for hoteliers to increase revenue from guests while opening up lines of revenue from locales. Those who embraced the opportunity to the fullest extent reaped the rewards. And then the pandemic hit.</p><p class="p1">The pandemic has been devastating in many ways, but as with natural disasters, the soil is left rich for new growth. In the food and beverage space, that new growth will be spurred on by true innovation and a challenge to rethink the standard-issue service models and offerings found in hotels.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">Innovation can come in all shapes and sizes, and the word itself represents a vast spectrum of opportunities. Suffice to say, the world is now the oyster of hotel and restaurant visionaries who dare to do something different. The thought alone could freeze up any would-be leader as overwhelming, but there are some smart places to start the thinking that can supply some footing for what could be next.</p><p class="p1">In a recent Clubhouse room, a number of innovations were discussed that are currently being applied to the hotel food and beverage space, or pose a large opportunity to be considered. These innovations and trends can be the spark and tinder for rethinking current experiences or the development of new concepts to be built.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">Here are three trends and innovations that are positioned to be winners in the post-pandemic reality.</p><p class="p1"><strong>1. Optimize for Off-Premise Fast Lane Pickups.</strong> Off-premise sales skyrocketed across the restaurant industry during the pandemic. Those who were apprehensive about this method of acquisition found themselves diving in and developing a new habit. Combined with many municipalities temporarily allowing off-premise alcohol sales and it’s safe to say the game has changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">Hotels that recognized the shift and make the operational pivots found traction in their use of the valet lanes. Shifting them to be fast-line pickups for third-party delivery or guests who ordered ahead created a high level of convenience. The result was a smooth experience with little friction increasing transactions while opening up a fresh line of revenue that had little considering pre-pandemic.</p><p class="p1"><strong>2. Food Trucks, Food Halls &amp; Pop-ups.</strong> In instances where a food and beverage outlet could not survive, or was temporarily closed, two opportunities arose. The hotel footprint and abundance of space are perfect for food trucks, food halls, and pop-up restaurants. Food trucks can easily enjoy space in an open-air parking lot or garage, creating a safe experience for guests while delivering fun novelty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">In some instances, food and beverage and meeting spaces were closed. The space is prime for pop-up experiences that would bring in new attention and traffic without the commitment of reopening or launching a new, permanent food and beverage concept. The idea of pop-ups could be worked into the overall brand experience and offering while creating a sense of wonder and intrigue with would-be guests while inviting the neighborhood to enjoy the space.</p><p class="p1">For a more permanent offering, the food hall model makes a lot of sense. Rather than committing to one concept, available space can be repurposed as a small food hall with multiple concepts available. The key here is to ensure that this doesn’t turn into a low-quality mall food court vibe, but instead features a level of craft and quality equivalent to food halls found around the United States.</p><p class="p1">A food hall offering would align very well with hotel brands that tout exploration and celebration of variety and culture. If done right, it could be a highly buzzworthy offering that sees exponential growth in neighborhood foot traffic as well as guest preference.</p><p class="p1"><strong>3. Automation &amp; Technology.</strong> Technology is the key to innovation. With integrated systems hotels and their F&amp;B concepts can gather data, iteratively learn and scale, and optimize the guest experience to all-new levels. The pandemic sparked numerous technological advancements including the aforementioned third-party delivery adoption surge. One of the other ways was how to hand-off food with little contact. Thus an old friend reared its head with a technological fresh coat of paint.</p><p class="p1">The Automat was a food concept that was built from the cafeteria and diner model. Rather than having human service, back of house workers would simply fill cubby holes with dishes available for purchase. Guests would peruse the cubbies, then pop in some change to unlock the door. They’d grab the plate of food and that was that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">A re-engineered version of the automat could be the key to hotels delivering fast and safe breakfast and lunch options as the buffet offering becomes obsolete due to safety concerns. The kitsch and playfulness of the system can create a fun alignment with the right hotel brand. But be warned, quality of food and freshness still matters most so maintaining this kind of system would take some thinking from an innovative mind.</p><p class="p1">These three trends and innovations should spark ideation and inspire new thinking in the food and beverage concept space. While the pandemic destroyed a lot of restaurant concepts and brands, the ground is primed for new growth and innovation. Now is the time to push the envelope and shed the classic ideas of what food and beverage can be to realize what food and beverage should be: an unforgettable, remarkable experience aligned with the core guest persona’s needs and wants. The brands that tackle this challenge can charge ahead of the herd while realizing new heights of revenue.</p><p class="p1">1 &#8211; https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.830&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</p>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an interior design that reflects a restaurant’s personality traits is crucial to its success. It creates visual consistency from what consumers are discovering online and in advertising, and in real life. But designing on-brand interiors for restaurants is more complicated than picking out matching colors and furniture. It involves creating an immersive experience that exceeds Patrons’ expectations throughout every part of  their journey.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESTABLISH A HEALTHY COLLABORATION</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to have a collaborative relationship between the architects, contractors, interior designer(s) and the brand/marketing strategists, especially if they are all from different companies. The</span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/how-to-brand-a-restaurant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brand strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and visual identity system should guide all design and architectural ideation and decisions. From that basis, the interior designer can collaborate with the graphic designers and pull spec or complementary colors to incorporate throughout the space. This brings the brand’s personality to life through the environment planning. It’s very important the digital and online presence has a working relationship with the interior space to create an immersive and cohesive brand experience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF THE CATEGORY</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept category (Full-service, QSR, Fast casual, etc.) will create a framework to determine the needs for the experience in order to make informed decisions. Lighting, textiles, finishes, decor, and music all play a part in the environment to carry the brand strategy and tell a memorable story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For QSRs and Fast casual concepts, the goal is to have a high turnover. Lighting, colors, music, and furniture all play a part in how this affects consumer behavior. This can include bright lighting and not-so-comfortable seating to induce patrons to eat and leave at a faster pace. This has been proven to make room for the next round of diners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The environments for full service are created for people to feel comfortable to stay longer and order more while they enjoy the occasion. For instance, booths with comfortable textiles, pillows, dim lighting, and music with slower BPM will keep guests staying longer and could increase check averages. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">STIMULATE THE SENSES</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants have the potential to be the most memorable experiences in people’s lives. </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/the-science-of-sensory-marketing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that brands are more memorable when they stimulate as many senses as possible. If you think about every sense that restaurants have opportunities with, it’s not a far fetched concept to stimulate all five.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right lighting, furniture finishes, menu material, colors, music, and being sure your cuisine’s aromas are wafting through the air should all be considerations when designing the physical customer journey. Do not overlook the small details of the environment and how you can evoke an emotion by stimulating the senses in various ways. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">COMBINE THE ELEMENTS TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior design begins coming together after months of sourcing, collaborating, and experimenting with options. Surgically combining the design and environmental elements will now create the ambience and set a predetermined mood for the brand. The ambience gives off an energy that should reflect your restaurant brand. It should also trigger an emotional state for the consumer who is within the space. These emotions, conscious and subconscious, will lead behavior for the remainder of the experience. When emotions are successfully triggered, this will leave a lasting impression keeping your restaurant brand top of mind. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambience of a restaurant is a curated puzzle that should seamlessly fit together when the process is complete. Interior design is the step in which the restaurant branding comes to life through creating an atmosphere that embodies the brand promise and fits the vibe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a cohesive brand experience is created, it builds trust, generates repeat business and </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/whats-the-roi-of-restaurant-branding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">elevates the organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a way that stands out from competitors. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After approximately 20 years of being involved in every aspect of the restaurant business from serving to being a one-person marketing department, I’ve seen first hand what successful restaurant marketing looks like. I have worked in national franchises, regional chains, and locally-owned restaurants that tripled in units. I grew from marketing brand manager into assisting new concept developments from idea to full execution. I’ve learned a lot in what goes into growing a restaurant brand and pulled key learnings on how to easily market your restaurant in 10 steps below.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Know your Patron as well as you know your product</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to start marketing your restaurant, you have to know who your core Patron is, how they behave, and what makes them tick. After understanding their dining habits and preferences, you’re able to look through the lens of your Patron to build a clear messaging path. Knowing your Patron will not only help develop your brand voice and how you will communicate with them, but also where and what channels they prefer to be communicated through. Stick to your bandwidth and grow communication channels so you know where they are first, before trying to communicate through all of them. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Be consistent like water</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more frustrating than seeing a restaurant throw out multiple messages and they all look, feel, and sound different. Consistency builds relationships and trust, whether it be through words, visuals, or the actual product. With so much competition out there, the experience should be consistent and reliable so your guests want to keep coming back! The most successful restaurant marketing strategies are the ones people remember for [insert the special something here], because they are consistent with their delivery. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Engage with your fans on social media</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating a metaphor from one of my favorite books, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UnMarketing-Stop-Marketing-Start-Engaging/dp/047061787X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UnMarketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Scott Stratten. How would you like to go into a room full of people and hand out flyers of what you’re selling, then turn around and leave without engaging in conversation? In order to build advocacy, you must develop relationships with your audience. Schedule a time to respond to comments and DMs, to make your guests feel heard. It will also give you a better understanding of their needs. Building relationships will not only strengthen your online presence and following, it will also encourage repeat business. We should all know that repeat business is the definition of success for restaurants. For other marketing tips specifically for Instagram click </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/7-restaurant-instagram-marketing-tips-for-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or check out how we engage digitally </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/restaurant-marketing-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Do the Google</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone is googling, Google it if you don’t believe me. If you aren&#8217;t showing up on Google when people are searching, you are missing out on an opportunity for your restaurant to be considered. At the bare minimum, You should be placing search and </span><a href="https://vigorbranding.com/projects/eriks-delicafe-character-advertising-campaigns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">display ads to build impressions and drive conversions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in parallel to your on premise activations. A 2019 restaurant study from </span><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/mobile-dining-research-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think with Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells us that consumers rely heavily on digital channels to help make their dining decisions—86% of dining research is done by mobile before visiting a restaurant. Helpful tips: Be sure your “Google My Business” page is stacked with vibrant food and interior photography, order button links, positive reviews, and easily accessed links to preferred destinations. Be sure there is a clear and easy way to find out more information about your restaurant so nothing stands in the way of the decision making process.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Don’t underestimate the power of the inbox</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times have you checked your email today? According to an </span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adobe/2019-adobe-email-usage-study"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe 2019 email usage study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average person is checking their personal email 2 hours per day. You see, email is still one of the most cost effective ways to directly reach your consumers who have already interacted, ordered, or dined within your restaurant. If you have something exciting to say or offer, it should be in an email. However, be careful not to overuse this platform for content that isn’t valuable or you’ll see a heat map hitting that unsubscribe button so fast your head will spin. Getting into someone’s inbox should be a privilege, not a right, so use the message wisely. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Invite local bloggers and foodies to come hang</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media has given us this lovely gift of networking and influencing. It has become a best practice at this point to engage with local foodies, bloggers, and critics for a chance to expose your restaurant to thousands of people who may not be aware of your brand and taking them straight to the consideration phase. This not only supports local influencers with their content and connects with your community but can add value to your brand’s personality. It’s a win-win, a marketing no-brainer.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Give it away, Give it away now</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t love FREE? Giving product away is the best way to drive trial and consideration. If you are a restaurant brand with a small marketing budget, the best way to give your guests a reason to believe is to give them the product to try and all it costs is what you paid for the ingredients. This tactic will help amplify your marketing initiatives by building your word of mouth reputation, connect with the locals, and encourage earned media (which is free!). If you want guests to try something new, you must give them a reason to risk the trial because we are creatures of habit and do what makes us feel safe and comfortable. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Prioritize and manage review sites</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of consumers look online when planning their next meal. When choosing a restaurant, </span><a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/word-of-mouth/millennial-restaurant-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gen Z and Millenials are 99% more likely to rely on online reviews and social media over the older generations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your review platforms will also tell you what guests are saying to pull out any patterns or recurring issues that need to be addressed. You should have a dedicated time slot to respond to positive and negative reviews in a genuine way, because no one wants to speak to a robot. You will not only see a return on the guests who have written the reviews but you will be displaying online that you are a brand that listens and is responsive, thus building relationships and trust.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Evaluate your tech stack</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year is 2021 and we are living in a post-pandemic aftermath. In order to successfully market your restaurant, you must be thinking digitally. Your Patron’s habits and needs have shifted for restaurant experiences. Your website, app (if applicable), loyalty program, email, and social media presence should be an omnichannel experience that make it seamless to drive desired actions. Keep these platforms simple, yet impactful, for the user to easily navigate and gather information. Your tech stack should be up to date and future proof for the ongoing evolution of technology and user needs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Plan, but plan to be agile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning big marketing initiatives and campaigns for your restaurant should always happen far in advance. You know the seasons, what holidays are coming, and what needs to be developed to keep things fresh. However, having the ability to think on your feet, notice trends and industry patterns will only improve your marketing performance. Keep your finger on the pulse in industry news and media trends. You will have a better understanding of emerging consumer needs and where the market is going. Though we encourage consistency, being agile is about having the courage to take risks with new tactics that could really make an impact. Balancing planning with agility is crucial in successfully marketing your restaurant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, the foundation of marketing should be built on connecting with your Patron. Being findable and driving people to purchase are all strategies that help in the consideration phase. However, it’s up to your restaurant to create memorable and consistent experiences to make them want to return.</span></p>

				<p>Ah&#8230; the Super Bowl. The event of the year where everyone gets that one (highly expensive) shot to put forth an ad that people will actually watch. In years past we&#8217;ve had many winners and losers – what the hell was Monkey Baby Puppy, Mt. Dew? We&#8217;ve had the notable, and the forgettable. So, what did this year bring?</p><p>True to 2020 fashion, absolute disappointment. And it may be safe to say, advertising is dead.</p><p>Before hopping ahead, our friends at Pavone have launched their <a href="https://spotbowl.com/">SpotBowl site where you can vote on this year&#8217;s ads. Go have a look!</a> This year&#8217;s Super Bowl ads fell into a few clear camps:</p><ol><li>2020 was tough and we&#8217;re here to make the world a better place so buy Product/ Service X.</li><li>We&#8217;re weird and funny and mostly obtuse, so buy Product/Service X.</li><li> Hey! Look at this 90&#8217;s throwback cultural reference. Buy Product/Service X.</li><li>In case you missed it. Paramount+ is launching. </li></ol><div> </div><div>Overall this netted out in a highly disappointing showing that left me wondering if today&#8217;s advertisers are even funny let alone relevant. Can they create serious ads and commercials that effectively connect, and does anyone buy into the sappy, emotionally driven narratives from brands that have done nearly nothing to believe they mean it?</div><div> </div><div>What I took away is that the ad industry is struggling to find connection in a medium that simply doesn&#8217;t connect any longer. The creative is weak and reliant on gimmicks and parlor tricks to beg and plead for attention. Put simply, it&#8217;s really sad.</div><div> </div><div>However, there were a few shining stars. I can&#8217;t tell if they&#8217;re great ads, or if the other ads were so bad that these ones stood out as a result. You be the judge. </div>					</div>

				<p>Okay, this connected big time. It mirrored the frustrations and laughable trials of 2020 in a way that a large number of people could relate to. It wasn&#8217;t about being desperate or downtrodden. It was about taking the issues last year brought with an attitude we can all relate to. It made us laugh as we looked back and a bumpy year and pulled in the product naturally. It gave a sense of much needed relief as opposed to a reminder of how rough it was. It didn&#8217;t seek to connect to the &#8220;we&#8217;re all in this together&#8221; emotionally saturated ilk we all had to stomach from advertisers while we were locked in our homes.</p><p>Grade: A</p>					</div>

				<p>E-Trade is another company who got the 2020 tone right. This commercial connected to the often times bloated goals of people in the pandemic who sought to better themselves. It was a great laugh as we&#8217;ve all understood that moment of trying to get into shape and getting disappointed with lack of results. The struggle is very real and we felt it. The sign-off really sealed the deal: This is the year you&#8217;ll get into shape&#8230; Financially, at least.</p><p>Grade: B+</p>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It goes without saying that 2020 was a nightmare of a year for everyone around the globe. Our industry – the restaurant industry – has been, and continues to be, decimated by the pandemic and political leadership. Just because the calendar popped into a new year, doesn&#8217;t mean the challenges stop. yes, the pandemic is here, and it&#8217;s surging. With that surge comes tough decisions from lawmakers on how to protect their constituents and reduce the pandemic&#8217;s impact. Unfortunately, those decisions may mean more stress applied to restaurants. Stress that many will not be able to bear. Things look bleak, yes, but there is a silver lining, dare I say?</p>
<p><strong>Struggle fuels innovation and the restaurant industry was built to innovate.</strong></p>
<p>With every tragedy, there exists a positive side. While no one wants to see more restaurants close, nothing can change what&#8217;s already happened, nor truly affect what will happen. However, we all can look to what&#8217;s next. Forest fires are devastating, but their aftermath creates a fertile foundation for new life and growth. Restaurateurs and visionaries stand at the precipice of an industry fertile with opportunities to create new experiences. Experiences designed and primed to align with new behaviors and new value systems fostered and built during the lockdowns and months that followed. Experiences created with today and tomorrow&#8217;s realities as a guiding light. Let&#8217;s have a look at some trends I think will help restaurant brands charge ahead.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Drive-throughs resurge</span></h3>
<p>Fast-casual restaurant concepts emerged in an answer to people wanting elevated options without the sit-down restaurant commitment. We wanted nicer, better food, and sexier interior experiences. It was a rejection of the fast-food experiences of our parent&#8217;s generations. The ones built on speed, efficiency, and cheap food. One iconic element of that fast-food revolution was the drive-through. Drive-throughs became passé to the fast-casual surge and indicated a lower quality of brand if one were present. So, any self-respecting fast-casual restaurant shunned the drive-through. But, then COVID happened.</p>
<p>During the pandemic lockdowns, restaurants with drive-throughs surged. A phenomenon we experienced first hand with a few of our clients. It was easy to keep socially distant while serving up the food that people wanted. It also allowed them to get out of their houses, see some human faces, and enjoy a taste of normalcy. This will not change post-pandemic, and in 2021 we&#8217;re already seeing brands react.</p>
<p>Many well-known restaurant brands have released their new prototypes and almost every single one has a drive-through. Even Shake Shack, the darling of the fast-casual world, has launched a prototype with a drive-through as the epicenter. But drive-throughs are not easily implemented. They come with the need for new, refined processes, training of staff, and the need for speed. New concepts are better positioned to capitalize than currently existing concepts that have to pivot, but the ones that ace this feature will realize successes and growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tech is no longer an unnecessary frill. It&#8217;s an absolute must. – Joseph Szala</p></blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Tech, tech, tech</span></h3>
<p>In 2018 I spoke at the FED Conference in Chicago on the topic of &#8220;Restaurants of the Future.&#8221; While I never could have predicted the pandemic, I did stress that if a restaurant brand didn&#8217;t already have a tech plan in the works, they would be left behind. I couldn&#8217;ve never predicted how drastically and violently consumer behaviors would shift in such a short period of time, but here we are. If you are not already tech-enabled as a restaurant, you are facing extinction. If you are not investing in tech-fueled systems across operations, marketing, and so on, you are facing extinction. Tech is no longer an unnecessary frill. It&#8217;s an absolute must.</p>
<p>Restaurants need to be built on the foundation of strong technology. Online ordering that seamlessly connects with CRM, point of sale, and digital menu boards are all necessary for the success of restaurants today and tomorrow. Technology is already driving the behavioral shifts and demands seen in the post-pandemic consumer. At this point, you&#8217;re either in or out and tech is the deciding factor.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. The human element &#8211; HR</span></h3>
<p>Good talent is hard to find, and this year it got even harder. Most restaurants invest very little in attracting talent to their brand. It&#8217;s seen as an afterthought, but having great talent is vitally important more now than ever before.</p>
<p>Restaurant brands need to take recruitment seriously. It requires a real investment into marketing specifically to the people you want to represent the brand. What do you stand for? What are the amenities and benefits of a career with the brand? What&#8217;s being offered and what&#8217;s in it for them? Brands need to not only talk a big game, they need to walk it, too.</p>
<p>Talent in today&#8217;s world is looking for employment with a stable company. One that offers them good pay, a future if desired, and the ability to make an impact.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Reprieve from the narrative</span></h3>
<p>We have been bombarded with the pandemic and political narratives spewed every day on every media channel. People are fatigued if not annoyed. They look for a reprieve from the doomsday talk and the brands that seek to capitalize on it. For instance, do we really need to hear &#8220;In these trying times&#8230;&#8221; one more time? I think not. Instead, brands need to offer people a legitimate escape from the stresses of life. Restaurants have an especially unique advantage here considering the offering of food, drink, and a bit of an escape.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Fiscal responsibility</span></h3>
<p>Consumers have been shellshocked by the pandemic&#8217;s economic effects and the uncertainty of the future. It&#8217;s led to eyes on the bank account and developing a sense of fiscal responsibility. As a result, consumers have started scrutinizing where their funds are spent. This shined a bright light on things like delivery and service fees from third-party delivery partners.</p>
<p>Restaurants should be developing value-focused options that maintain quality and flavor but at an approachable price point. Additionally, brands need to look for ways to realize efficiencies and reduce the costs passed through to the customer. From here on out, our world is shifted to a more frugal-minded consumer group that still wants high quality. The brands that answer on the brands that will charge ahead.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Virtue signaling vs. doing</span></h3>
<p>As discussed in the need for a reprieve from the narrative, people are fatigued with the same one-liners. And overuse of such narrative-driven pleas for sales, people are now skeptical and asking the right question: What are you DOING about it?</p>
<p>Virtue signaling from brands isn&#8217;t enough to foster belief in your brand&#8217;s values. People want to see action and they want to see it often. If you&#8217;re going to say &#8220;we&#8217;re all in this together&#8221; then how do you live that as a brand? How do you show that you are doing everything possible to be in it together? If you can&#8217;t show it, don&#8217;t bother saying it. The consumer&#8217;s nose for BS is powerful these days.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Virtual kitchen wars</span></h3>
<p>Finally, but not least of all, the virtual kitchen format is burgeoning. And with the opportunities come all the challenges. Virtual kitchens are not immune to the challenges faced by standard format restaurants. In fact, they have a compounded scenario where new challenges are added to the standard ones.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with virtual kitchen brands is their lust for new concepts. Because they&#8217;re easy to create and launch, visionaries can easily fall victim to overloading the kitchen&#8217;s capability on the operations side. From the marketing side, every new brand created is a brand that needs to be marketed, and so far these virtual kitchen brands aren&#8217;t funded more or less than other restaurant brands. Yet, they have multiple brands to market along with their umbrella brand. It&#8217;s complicated and complex, to say the least.</p>
<p>Just as fast as this new format has taken hold, the weak ones will start to fail out. Welcome to the virtual kitchen wars of 2021.</p>
<p>2021 is a new year and a new opportunity to charge ahead with strong restaurant brand and marketing strategies. The trends covered in this report are only the top few that we see coming down the pike, or manifesting before our eyes in real time. With the right partners inside and outside the organization, restaurant brands can take big leaps ahead as the industry continues to shake out the weak from the strong. Good thing at Vigor we help build strong brands!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 is just around the corner, and with the new year comes new ways of connecting with potential patrons and curating branded content. Instagram is quickly becoming the most invaluable methods brands have to grow their audience and interest consumers. Within the restaurant industry, it&#8217;s all about elevating the experience. While the end goal is to get people into your space and drive sales, being Insta-famous goes a loooong way. Check out our handy-dandy tips below to score those likes, reposts, and shares:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Familiarize yourself with the new Instagram format and strategize how that can increase sales</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First thing’s first. Make sure your brand has the latest Instagram layout complete with the Grid, Reels, IGTV, Shopify (if you sell merch or gift cards online), Filters, and Tagged thumbnails. You want your brand to come across as up to date in comparison to your competitors. Utilize the “link in bio” feature on promotional posts to drive traffic to your website or any other conversion landing page. Establish a mini goal for each post to be sure you are leading your followers to the right place at the right time with little to no effort on their part. The easier the user experience is to go through, the more conversions you will notice over time and it generates repeat business. Online user experience is key now that 2020 has shifted everything into digitally-focused interactions, so you want your patrons to have a convenient, easy, and simple way to find what they want.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Incorporate more influencers and UGC for more local engagement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Influencer” has become a side hustle or full time job for many as social media grows as a marketer’s dream for advertising, building brand awareness, and customer reach. When searching for a local Instagram influencer, check out your explore page and foodie driven hashtags to pinpoint those individuals that have a great following in the community. Be sure their personality traits and lookalike audience aligns with your brand’s to determine if it’s the right fit. Incorporating influencer partnerships and community-led content not only expands your reach and brand awareness but it gives you more diversified content that is less promotional and shows that you are </span><a href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-aesthetic-trends/#edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually listening to your audience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Design Branded AR filters and stickers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a specialty you may have to outsource or have your graphic designer learn to use since it’s a very specific AR software platform. However, these work to increase engagement, brand awareness, and they enhance the customer experience. For instance, if your brand creates a filter and your advocates are using it on their stories, their followers will see your brand at the top of their page. If they want the filter installed on their phone, they must follow the brand and install the filter onto their Instagram, creating a chain reaction. It must be a filter that fits your brand but also comes in demand from your engaged audience. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Get innovative with your food and drink content</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousel posts </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/10-instagram-trends-you-need-to-know-in-2021-infographic/589520/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so why not be innovative in the way you present this type of post to your followers? For restaurants, it could be as simple as building one of your famous dishes step by step in each photo as the user swipes. Or coming up with ways to use your dishes as leftovers with items lying around on Reels. Valuable content comes in many forms but overall should evoke an emotion, be aesthetically captivating, and/or solve a problem to get your followers engaged and interested.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Advertise on Instagram stories </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen substantial growth in Instagram stories, outperforming posts in the traditional feed with impressions and completion rates for branded content. In 2019, marketers were already using </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">⅓ of their Instagram budget on stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so if you haven’t jumped on the bandwagon already you should plan to in 2021. We recommend designing a series of slides that tells an engaging story about what sets your restaurant apart from your competitors. At the end of the story, be sure to include a CTA to swipe up and include your website for a simplified journey. The less moves your prospective consumer has to make, the more likely they will discover and convert.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Cross promote your other platforms </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a strong social media presence on other channels and Instagram is a great bridge to promote those. Being present on different channels allows you and your brand to interact with a variety of audiences, formats, and languages, so it could assist in identifying content that appeals to a broader audience. This allows you to develop a more diverse way of communicating, and increases your network. Another perk of being consistently active on different platforms is that it improves your search engine ranking thus driving traffic, and ultimately sales. Promotion isn’t limited to talking about your other platforms either; screenshot Twitter interactions with customers and post it on Instagram, share heartfelt Facebook reviews, even </span><a href="https://later.com/blog/get-instagram-followers-from-tiktok/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post relevant TikToks (either created user-generated or made by you) on your Reels feed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Reposting great content from your other platforms is a great way to create meaningful interactions on your IG profile—don’t forget to link your accounts together!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Hire a creative content creator</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days of low quality shot photos, video, and mediocre text overlays. You don’t have to have the best equipment to get quality imagery and video, you just need someone who understands the tricks of the trade and/or software tools to get those produced looking shots and branded content. Regardless of product or brand, high quality images and graphics are more likely to drive interactions. The content and composition of your photos and videos, not just as individual posts, but also in relation to your Instagram grid and overall look. You want to make sure, and we really can’t emphasize this enough, that your aesthetic is purposeful, and is well, actually aesthetic. </span></p>
