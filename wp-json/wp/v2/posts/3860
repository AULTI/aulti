(In all honesty, many people have asked me, and Tony was in the top five.) Unfortunately, I never had the honor, and now I never will besides time spent binge watching No Reservations and Parts Unknown.<\/p>\n<p>If you didn\u2019t know him as a chef, you certainly knew him as a culinary journalist and personality. \u201cPersonality\u201d being a drastic understatement. He was an entertainer. A lover of food, and, more importantly, he adored the peoples and cultures that create the food. A true philanthropist documenting and basking in the beauty of humanity. He was curious, irreverent, unapologetic, self-deprecating at times, hilarious all the time, and a true master craftsman in the kitchen and on the screen.<\/p>\n<p>Tony took us around the world. He introduced us to the adventure found in the world of culinary endeavors. He brought food back to its roots with attitude and panache. We saw places through his eyes and his heart. Places many of us will never see in real life, yet\u2026 we have a sense of having been there before. Anthony connected people and food and a common denominator that ties us all together. Despite some internet criticism, he showed us that conflicts can be put on ceasefire, and even go as far as to create common ground between millennia-old enemies. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/video\/shows\/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown\/season-2\/jerusalem\/index.html\">See Parts Unknown \u2013 Jerusalem.<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>He leaves us better then he found us. We\u2019re more cultured, and more open to trying new things and new ideas. We find beauty in what food really is, pivotal sensory experiences that tap the five senses and the soul. And just when he would have you raise to create an alter and start worshipping culinary brilliance, he\u2019d tell you,\u00a0<strong>\u201cI, personally, think there is a really danger of taking food too seriously. Food should be part of the bigger picture.\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0Reminding us that there is so much more to this life, this world, and those of us who get to inhabit it for a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>Tony once said, \u201cYou learn a lot about someone when you share a meal together.\u201d Although I\u2019ll never have that honor, I\u2019ve learned more than I could imagine.<\/p>\n<p>Rest peacefully, Mr. Bourdain, you crazy, amazing sunuvabitch.<\/p>\n<p>-Joseph<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3861\" src=\"https:\/\/vigorbranding.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/static1.squarespace.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Bourdain quote\" width=\"1000\" height=\"523\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If someone asked me to list 10 people I\u2019d love to spend time with, Anthony Bourdain would have easily been top five.
