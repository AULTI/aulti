It\u2019s no secret that employers look at applicant\u2019s social media profiles before calling for an interview. But if you are leading a brand right now and\/or in charge of marketing your company to attract employees, go look at any of your social handles right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, seriously, I\u2019ll wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On your page yet? It\u2019s true: Applicants are screening you too and this is what they see. So let\u2019s ask the hard question: Would YOU work for your company based on what you see?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The projection of your company and\/or brand on social media not only attracts consumers but also determines what type of talent you will attract. Social media users follow accounts they are inspired by and what they consider valuable content based on their interests. The visuals, vibe, and language should clearly depict your brand\u2019s authenticity. As people start to dig into your posts, they should gain a clear understanding of the answers to the following questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you celebrate your employees?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you involved in your community or any charitable organizations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is the culture there?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you stand for? What is your WHY?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The higher your social presence is on social media, the more information potential employees have access to in order to make the decision if they want to work for you or not. It\u2019s important to have a positive online presence that gives clarity to these questions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must also mention the next generation of employees. Gen Z currently makes up 10% of the workforce and have grown up in a digital world, training themselves to read reviews and research products before making purchasing decisions. This habit has shifted into carefully selecting the companies they work for. Sites like Glassdoor and Linkedin provide full transparency and endless content about a company\u2019s core values, leadership, pay, and employee feedback. Social media sites are real-time communications of not only a company\u2019s product or service, but also a platform to open the conversation on social issues and where they stand in today\u2019s climate, which is a high priority for this generation in particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was scrolling through my personal LinkedIn a while back, I came across a new question for applicants to ask potential employers was \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do for your employees during the height of the pandemic?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let that sink in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be prepared and proud to answer this question. Interviewing is a two-way street. Among so many things we are learning throughout this pandemic, perspective is key. People don\u2019t want to work for just anyone because they feel like they have no choice, there are too many options now with remote work. They want to work for brands that complement their personalities and beliefs, enhance their strengths, and will provide opportunities for growth and stability. All characteristics that can easily come across on your social media platforms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reviewing with a potential employee\u2019s perspective and feel you need more than product and\/or service on social media, here are a few quick tips to incorporate in the content mix:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees who love what they do and are ambassadors for your company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes at work, show your audience what it\u2019s really like to work there.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charities you partner with or donate to along with their story.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community service your team participates in.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be consistent with your brand voice and tone, it shows the type of personality your company holds.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quotes from the company\u2019s leaders, whether they be funny or inspiring, they should be relatable and in alignment with the brand\u2019s personality.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPerception is reality\u201d is a phrase we hear often in food and beverage, retail, and customer service industries. One of the goals of social media should be to be perceived as a great company to work for, a company that attracts exciting talent after they research and make the decision to apply. Job searching and research has evolved so we must stay in the know of what future employees value and how we can make our companies a place they are proud to work!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let\u2019s flip the script in this article.
