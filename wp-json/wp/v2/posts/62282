Since joining the team, JP has played integral roles in building the brands across marketing channels for companies like eegee\u2019s and Erik\u2019s DeliCaf\u00e9.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her keen sense of what\u2019s trending and your ability to \u201clisten\u201d to data empowers her to be a powerful brain on every endeavor. Prior to Vigor, JP cut her teeth on Tin Lizzy&#8217;s Cantina, Southern Proper Hospitality Group (Beni&#8217;s Cubano, Chido and Padre&#8217;s.) In that experience, she helped the brands reach new heights with their marketing. In fact, she loves really digging deep to solve issues in order to allow brands to better connect with their consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But outside of her disciplines, what makes JP unique?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ms. Myler loves to paint when she gets the time and loves the fashion and beauty worlds. She actually has a degree in Fashion marketing from Savannah College of Art &amp; Design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When she\u2019s not working like crazy for our clients, she juggles the various aspects of family life. You may find her on the sidelines of her sons\u2019 games, or playing fetch with her goldendoodle, Sam. As she likes to say: #BoyMom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We asked JP a few more questions about her passions and what makes her tick. Here are her responses:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you could rebrand any F&amp;B company, what would it be and why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be Padriac&#8217;s in Vinings. There is so much growth potential within those four walls and it&#8217;s right down the road from the Brave&#8217;s stadium. The employees and owner are amazing but I think they lost a connection somewhere along the line&#8230;is it Irish? Is it American? Is it a bar? There is a lost connection between the VIS, menu offerings, interior design, marketing, etc. If budget weren&#8217;t an issue I would love to consult smaller business owners on how to improve their brand voice and visual messaging throughout all consumer touch points.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s your bucket-list vacation destination\/experience?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many! My top two are New Zealand and Italy. I&#8217;m so inspired by nature, landscape, architecture, and history that I feel these two places would fuel my soul. I had to take so many art history classes in college that I don&#8217;t think my degree would be 100% complete without seeing some of it in person while in Italy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s your go-to drink?<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give me a good skinny margarita and no one gets hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re so pumped to have her here at Vigor and look forward to new challenges for clients current and future. So, bring it on!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JP joined the Vigor team earlier this year to head up the marketing strategy for our key client accounts.
