It didn\u2019t matter which won the battle, the end result was the same. You wanted a delicious breakfast right this second and the only answer was McDonald\u2019s. Except, it was now 10:17 and the closest Mickey D\u2019s was at least 10 minutes away. Looks like burgers are the only option.<\/p>\n<p id=\"7cc6\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">This was the struggle almost every human had at least once in their life, if not every weekend morning. The problem persisted for decades with no resolution ever breaching the horizon. Until McDonald\u2019s finally wised up to the plight of the people and made their breakfast available all. day. long. Boom. Brilliance unleashed.<\/p>\n<p id=\"bfdf\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">As brilliant as the decision was, I have to wonder what took so long to make it? If there was one common issue with McDonald\u2019s that existed even before the health-kick trend unfurled, it was that people wanted breakfast after 10:30am. Unfortunately, McDonald\u2019s failed to pick up what the people were putting down. Instead, they tackled the task of fixing the damage caused by a devastating aftermath from tell-all expos\u00e9s like SuperSize Me. From those that don\u2019t know, this film and others like it shined a light on the unhealthiness of the brand\u2019s cuisine. Health was brought to the forefront of the conversation and McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.<\/p>\n<p id=\"0595\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">The behemoth of an issue, Healthier Eating, quite understandably became the focus of the brand\u2019s charge forward. But breakfast, the one place untouched by health concerns, was forgotten or tabled indefinitely. And so it sat until uncovered by a brilliant explorer.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2c76\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">McDonald\u2019s move to offer breakfast all day isn\u2019t groundbreaking. It\u2019s not a fresh thought. It\u2019s a no-brainer response to a decades long demand that someone finally listened to. The results speak for themselves (McDonald\u2019s stock climbed and continues the ascent at the time of this article\u2019s crafting.)<\/p>\n<p id=\"3a0d\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">So, what can you learn from the All Day Breakfast no-brainer?<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"b4b7\" class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Actually listen to people<\/h4>\n<p id=\"20c7\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\">People are going to complain, especially in this world teeming with entitled Millennial. Not all the complaints are worth listening to, but there will be common patterns that emerge. Those patterns need addressed. Sometimes the answer is simple, sometimes it\u2019s a little tougher than it may seem.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"9d82\" class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Find a way<\/h4>\n<p id=\"8e19\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\">I hear a lot of excuses for not doing innovative things. \u201cNo one else does it that way.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult.\u201d The fact is I see these as reasons TO actually do them. To find a way to make it work. If it were easy, everyone would be doing it. If everyone is doing it, it\u2019s not worth doing at all in the first place.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"26e2\" class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Path of least resistance, positivity first<\/h4>\n<p id=\"41f2\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\">If the two major complaints were the unhealthy nature of McDonald\u2019s food and the short stop on the breakfast offering then the team is left with a choice. Which do we tackle first. The perception of health is mammoth without a simple, short term solution. Breakfast is much easier and positively charged. I mean, people wanting the food is a good thing. This path is the fruit to pick first. Doing so will add positivity to the brand while the team figures out how to fix the health perception.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9930\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">There are probably more tidbits of intelligence to glean from McDonald\u2019s.
